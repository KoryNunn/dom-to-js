dom-to-js
=========

# What #

Creates DOM-generating-code, from DOM

# Why? #

Say you need to create some DOM in JS, and you already have the DOM generated from another source, this writes the code to do the same for you.

The outputted code is not pretty, but I'm sure you know how to pretify JS...

toLaconic.js is a jQuery plugin that converts selected elements to an array of strings. 

The strings are JavaScript that can be used to create the targeted element again, in laconic.

# Future #

I plan to add to this repo with a non-jQuery reliant script that can be extended to generate JavaScript for any DOM creation library.
